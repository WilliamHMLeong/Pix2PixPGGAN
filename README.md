# Pix2Pix PGGAN(Using PGGAN as Pix2Pix for generating high resolution images)
  This is an implementation of Pix2Pix PGGAN on python 3.6 and Tensorflow. People can input original images such as face edges or some other objects and get the specific results from the outputs with high resolution. Pix2Pix PGGAN is based on Progressive Growth GAN released by NVDIA. There are two structures such as None U-Net structure and U-Net structure will be implemented in the Pix2Pix PGGAN.
The code is designed to be extended easily. You can change the code such as input resolution and output resolution to what you need easily.
